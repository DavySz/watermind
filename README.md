The mobile application that aims to report explicit water leakage

Main goal:
Designing software to reduce the response time of the bodies responsible for solving the problem of leaking drinking water during its distribution.

Specific objectives
- Facilitate communication between the citizen who found a failure in distribution and the responsible body
- Optimize the response time of the organs to solve the problem, reduce the amount of water lost in the failure.
- Analyze the main points of failures in the distribution
- Implement intuitive software for easy use

Practical Applications Project presented as a Final Project to the Technical Course in Informatics at Fundação Matias Machline as a requirement for obtaining the title of Technician in Informatics.

In the process of water supply through distribution networks, losses of water resources can occur as a result of various causes, such as: leaks and unauthorized consumption. These losses bring negative impacts to the environment, revenue and production costs of companies, burdening the system as a whole, and ultimately affecting all consumers.

Therefore, as a way to intervene in this problem, the project presented in this work aims to develop a software, whose main objective is to optimize the resolution time of leaks exposed in the water network during its distribution, based on complaints made by the population of the respective failures, to the closest responsible bodies that will be able to take the necessary measures in a shorter time, thus minimizing losses due to leakage.
